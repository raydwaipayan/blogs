Process A process is simply an instance of an executing program. It consists of an executing program, its current values, state information and the resources used by the operating system to manage the execution of that process.
In a UNIX-based system, each process is isolated from each other. From the viewpoint of the process, it appeats to have control over and access to all the system resources as they were all of their own.</description></item><item><title>Linux Kernel checkpatch.pl mentorship</title><link>https://raydwaipayan.github.io/blogs/posts/linux-kernel-mentorship/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Mar 2021 02:05:17 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://raydwaipayan.github.io/blogs/posts/linux-kernel-mentorship/</guid><description>Checkpatch - What is it? checkpatch.pl is a trivial style checker for patches sent to the linux kernel.
Why is it needed you say? I did an analysis on checkpatch warnings on about 50k commits from v5.4. (Find the full report here )
The top errors were then generated via the following shell command:
cat checkpatch_out_50k.txt | grep -oP &amp;quot;(?:WARNING|ERROR|CHECK):(\w+)&amp;quot; \ | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n6 Count of errors Error Types Error 41999 CHECK CAMELCASE 13629 CHECK PARENTHESIS_ALIGNMENT 11491 WARNING LONG_LINE 8106 CHECK SPACING 6825 WARNING LEADING_SPACE 4394 CHECK OPEN_ENDED_LINE As we can see, the number of stylistically incorrect bits still continue to exist and are still merged into the kernel code.</description></item></channel></rss>
